First of all I had a great experience doing this hackathon... maybe because I was on the others too... so I knew what to expect.

So, the *good things*: a lot of learning, between trying to communicate with a lot of people at the same time and how we tried
to resolve the trouble git causes to us, well not actually git but our lack of knowledge, here is where the

*bad things*: personally I think I failed, I was the product manager... and because the time consuming trying to solve merge
conflicts I couldn't review everyones work. 

I guess that a couple of hours were necessary to planificate and scheduled the whole work
and not doing on the go, and secondly our git workflow, it was a mess everytime someone push to master. 

Hope in the mastering git and github chapters we learn about the best approaches to avoid this time consuming and copy-paste
hack editing.

But hey, everyone did a great job... we create more than the 5 elements we were assigned plus the website.
