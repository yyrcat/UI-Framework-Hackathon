First of all I had a great experience doing this hackathon... maybe because I was on the others too... so I knew what to expect.

So, the *good things*: a lot of learning, between trying to communicate with a lot of people at the same time and how we tried
to resolve the trouble git causes to us, well not actually git but our lack of knowledge, here is where the

*bad things*: personally I think I failed, I was the product manager... and because the time consuming trying to solve merge
conflicts I couldn't review everyones work. 

I guess that a couple of hours were necessary to planificate and scheduled the whole work
and not doing on the go, and secondly our git workflow, it was a mess everytime someone push to master. 

Hope in the mastering git and github chapters we learn about the best approaches to avoid this time consuming and copy-paste
hack editing.

But hey, everyone did a great job... we create more than the 5 elements we were assigned plus the website.

The hackathon was a great experience. I really enjoyed working with team 9. @luis_rojas did a great job keeping the team up to date and coordinating everyone.

My main role was to create components. We were each assigned 3 or 4 components and were able to start in right away. I was able to work through 5 components. They aren't as polished as I would have liked but that was mainly due to having to help my teammates when issues arose. Stoping to help them made the team stronger and I can iterate over the components to clean them up at a later date.

The hardest thing in during the process was everyone working on the index file at once. It created a lot of merge conflicts but we all moved through them smoothly and helped each other when needed.

Overall I this experience was pretty fun as well as challenging.
